# Machine-Learning

These is the repository of PINN codes for solving quantum eigenvalue problems used in my MS thesis, where we extended and redesigned the existing architecture for solving such problems. Our algorithm is unique because we can guarantee stability and is computationally efficient. 

I will continue to update this repository as we move further in the project
